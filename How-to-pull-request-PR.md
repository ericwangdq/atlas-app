## Git Workflow

We use [Github workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as our git workflow. **Nobody is allowed to push changes to `master` branch directly** and you need follow below steps to commit code to this repo:

1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and check out to it
2. Start coding, add commits and push them
3. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) (aka `PR`)
4. Discuss and review your code in your pull request page
5. Merge your code into master after review
6. \[optional\] Delete your branch in just [one click](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request/)

You can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to help you play with above workflow more smoothly.
